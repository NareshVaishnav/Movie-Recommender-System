-------------Movie Recommendation System -------

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project! This project utilizes machine learning techniques and various libraries 
to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and historical data. The system is designed to assist 
users in discovering new movies tailored to their individual tastes.

Features :-
Data preprocessing: The project includes a comprehensive data preprocessing and cleaning pipeline to ensure high-quality 
input for accurate recommendations.

Feature extraction and vectorization: Advanced feature extraction techniques are employed to capture important attributes 
of movies, allowing for effective comparison and recommendation.

Machine learning algorithms: The system utilizes various machine learning algorithms to build a robust recommendation 
engine that learns from user behavior and provides accurate suggestions.

User interface: The system is integrated with Streamlit, a user-friendly web application framework, to provide an 
intuitive and interactive user interface. Users can effortlessly explore and discover movies based on their preferences.
